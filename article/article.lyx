\begin_layout Abstract
The distribution of errors is a central object in the assesment and benchmarking
 of computational chemistry methods.
 The popular and often blind use of the mean unsigned error as a benchmarking
 statistic leads to ignore distributions features that impact the reliability
 of the tested methods.
 We explore how the Gini coefficient offers a global representation of the
 errors distribution, but, except for extreme values, does not enable an
 unambiguous diagnostic.
 We propose to relieve the ambiguity by applying the Gini coefficient to
 mode-centered error distributions.
 This version can usefully complement the mean unsigned error and alert
 on problematic error sets.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reliability of a computational chemistry method is conditioned by the
 distribution of its prediction errors.
 Distributions with heavy tails elicit a risk of large prediction errors.
 As a benchmarking statistic, the popular mean unsigned error (MUE) bears
 no information on such a risk 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pernot2015,Pernot2018,Pernot2020,Pernot2020a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We have recently reported a case where two unbiased error distributions
 with identical values of the MUE present widely different risks of large
 errors because of heavy tails in one of them 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pernot2020b,Pernot2020a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 It would therefore be very useful to complement the MUE with a statistic
 indicating or quantifying the risk of large errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We recently proposed alternative statistics such as 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{95}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pernot2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\eta}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pernot2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and systematic improvement probability (SIP) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pernot2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In terms of risk, these statistics offer the following interpretations:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is a 5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

% risk for absolute errors to exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{95}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\eta}$
\end_inset

 that absolute errors are larger than a chosen threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\eta}$
\end_inset

 provides a direct quantification of the risk of large errors, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 has to be defined 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 and might be user-dependent, which complicates its reporting in benchmarking
 studies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For two methods 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{2}$
\end_inset

, the SIP provides the system-wise probability that the absolute errors
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{1}$
\end_inset

 are smaller than the absolute errors of 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{2}$
\end_inset

, informing on the risk incurred by switching between two methods.
 Interestingly, the SIP analysis provides a decomposition of the MUE difference
 between two methods in terms of gain and loss probabilities

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{95}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\eta}$
\end_inset

 partly answer the question, but they are point estimates on the cumulated
 density function of the absolute errors, and a more global statistic, accountin
g for the whole distribution might be of interest.
 Besides, it is well established in econometrics that measures of dispersions
 such as the variance perform poorly at risk estimation and that higher
 moments of the distributions have to be considered 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bonato2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This would lead us to such measures as skewness and kurtosis, but none
 of these alone would be able to cover all the scenarii.
 The risk of large errors through heavy tails of the errors distribution
 might be associated with large skewness or large kurtosis or a combination
 of them.

\begin_layout Standard
The Lorenz curve 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is widely used in econometrics to represent the distribution of wealth
 in human populations.
 Its summary statistics, notably the Gini coefficient (noted

)

 It is also used in biology to estimate the inequality of properties within
 plant populations

 Let us consider a set of errors (

\end_inset

), derived from a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

The mean signed error (MSE) is estimated as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\frac{\text{1}}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}e_{i}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As one is not dealing with necessarily symmetric distributions, the mode
 is an interesting location statistic, notably in correspondence to the
 tails of a distribution.
 The mode locates the part of the population with the highest density, which
 is expected to bring a large contribution to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{F}$
\end_inset

, and therefore influence the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient.
 As one cannot assume the unimodality of the underlying distributions, one
 will consider the main mode.

It is important to note that we explore only distributions with a single
 dominant, more or less structured peak, such as the ones encountered in
 most computational chemistry error datasets.
 It is easy to design multi-peaked distributions for which our conclusions
 on the Gini coefficient would not be valid.
 In fact, none of the usual summary statistics (MUE, MSE, skewness, kurtosis...)
 would describe properly such distributions.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As underlined above, the Gini coefficient is influenced both by the position
 and shape of the distribution.
 In order to map the correlations of the Gini coefficient with other statistics,
 we generated an ensemble of datasets from standard distributions with varying
 degrees of bias (NormBias), asymmetry (GandH), kurtosis (Student) and some
 combinations of these (StudentBias, GandHBias).
 These seven datasets are described in Table

In its usual application fields, the Gini coefficient is applied to distribution
s with positive support.
 Our application to computational chemistry error sets involves the intermediate
 folding operation, which is not reversible.
 In a first part, we show how this limits the information on the errors
 distribution that can be inferred from the Gini coefficient.
 To relieve this difficulty, we propose a mode-centering operation before
 folding, which better preserves some of the tail properties of the original
 distributions.
 The Gini coefficient is then compared to other tails statistics, notably
 at the level of statistical uncertainty.

The zero-centered unimodal symmetric distributions (normal and Student's)
 have their maximal 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{F}$
\end_inset

 value when the bias is null.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{F}$
\end_inset

 curve for the uniform distribution reaches 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{FU}=1/3$
\end_inset

 when the distribution is centered or shifted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

.
 For smaller absolute values of the bias, the folded distribution is not
 uniform and presents higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{F}$
\end_inset

.
 The value decreases when the bias is large enough to exclude zero from
 the range of non-null densities.
 Having heavier tails, the Student's-
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 distribution has a larger Gini coefficient than the normal.
 Any added bias leads to a decrease of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{F}$
\end_inset

.
 The decay curves are symmetric with respect to the sign of the bias.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is no longer the case for asymmetric distributions (lognormal and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

-and-
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

), for which the peak is reached for non-null values of the bias and the
 decay curves are non-symmetric.

(b) we plotted identical curves for distributions centered on their mode
 before adding a bias (except for the uniform distribution which has been
 left unchanged).
 This shows that the maximal value of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{F}$
\end_inset

 is reached when the mode of the distribution is at, or near, the origin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important point illustrated by these curves is that the level of
 information that can be recovered from 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{F}$
\end_inset

 depends on its value, and does not necessarily inform us on the shape of
 the distribution.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{F}=0.41$
\end_inset

 might as well occur for a centered normal distribution than for positively
 or negatively biased Student's-
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, lognormal of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

-and-
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 distributions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, within the restrictions on the distributions shapes we considered
 above, and if one considers the centered uniform distribution as an extreme
 case of unimodality, one might infer that values smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{FU}=1/3$
\end_inset

 are likely to reveal biased error distributions, while values above 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{FN}=0.41$
\end_inset

 are likely to signal distributions with (at least) an extended tail compared
 to normal tails, and a possible bias.
 Between these limits, compensations between bias and shape factors prevent
 any inference on either of them.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $0.35\le G\le0.5$
\end_inset

: no information on distributions shape, due to possible cancellation between
 bias and shape (tails); this could be considered as a

 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 scale; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $0.5\le G$
\end_inset

: heavy tails, either due to a strong asymmetry or to a large kurtosis;
 this might also reveal a dominant role of outliers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some datasets fall fully within the blind zone, between 0.35 and 0.5 (NAR2019,
 ZHA2018), but most have some elements outside, that would require some
 attention.
 For instance, errors on polarizabilities in the WU2015 dataset (blue dots)
 present many methods with large bias, and a few with no bias and heavy
 tails.
 As discussed in the source paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

, a non-negligible part of the reference dataset of experimental static
 polarizabilities presents large measurement uncertainties, which can be
 an important source of outliers.

 As expected, almost all sets with

 (green dots) shift after centering to larger 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 values and fall in the gray and red classes.
 Considering the gray dots, a large portion shifts to the red class, confirming
 the presence of a compensation between bias and shape factors in this class.
 Finally, most of the red class remains unchanged, with several points enduring
 a significant reduction of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 value.
 A remarkable example is the extreme point at 
\begin_inset Formula $G=0.66$
\end_inset

, which shifts to a value of 0.49.
 The corresponding set (CAM-B3LYP from PER2018) contains a zero-centered
 sharp peak, and an asymmetric set of large outliers.
 Its global centering pushes the main peak slightly off-center, a move associate
d with a reduction of the

 Similar features are observed for the third largest

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to avoid the blind zone effect observed above and be able to characteri
ze the shape of a distribution, mode-centering seems to offer an interesting
 way to relieve the bias/shape compensation.
 Centering a distribution before folding it mixes the contributions of both
 tails, but ensures that the contribution of the heaviest tail will be accounted
 for.
 This might not be the case when a tail is folded around zero.
 For asymmetric distribution, centering on other location statistics (mean
 or median) would not maximize the 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{F}$
\end_inset

 value and therefore preserve some ambiguity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assertion that mode-centering maximizes

 The dispersion of the points for the literature datasets about this curve
 is mostly due to statistical uncertainty (the points for the largest dataset
 (ZAS2019,

 It is important to note that the uncertainty on

(a)), all the points seem to lie within an angular sector, indicating that
 distributions with large skewness have large 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{MCF}$
\end_inset

 For instance, if the skewness is above 0.3,

 is larger than 0.5.
 Reciprocally,

(b)), there is a lax positive trend between both statistics, and, globally,
 large values of

 tails or outliers.
 In both graphs, values of

 The authors discussed how this DFA is in the head group of two methods

 From the same set, B3LYP has the second largest

 The third largest 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{MCF}$

 value (0.61, violet dot) belongs to the ZAS2019 dataset, and presents a
 null skewness and a large kurtosis.

, where the errors distribution for the SLATM-L2 method was shown to have
 problematic large tails, despite having the smallest MUE among the compared
 methods.
 In the same set, the MP2 method has a practically normal errors distribution
 and can be found in the lower part of the Gini scale (0.42).
 This analysis can be repeated for the ten methods with largest

For mode-centered error sets,

 is correlated to both 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{CS}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{GM}$
\end_inset

.
 The correlation is best visible in 3 -dimensional plots.
 Instead of considering the properties of the errors distributions, one
 might consider directly the shape properties of the absolute errors distributio
n after mode-centering.
 In this case, one expects that the importance of the tail should be measured
 by a skewness coefficient.
 We name 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{GMF}$
\end_inset

 the skewness of the folded mode-centered distribution.
 The correlation between 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{GMF}$

 It seems that below

 have a non-negligible risk of large prediction errors.

If one considers the first rank, five methods are flagged by the test.
 Cases ZAS2019 and PER2018 have been discussed above.

ZHA2018 is at the limit, SCAN errors with notable excess kurtosis, but nothing
 exceptional.

\color inherit
 For BOR2019, all methods present some excess kurtosis and variable levels
 of skewness.
 The first ranked method (mBJ) has the largest skewness in the set.
 For case THA2015, all methods are flagged, which might point to the existence
 of global outliers in the reference dataset, 
\emph on
i.e.
 
\emph default
data that no method in the panel is able to predict correctly.

(b), where the same analysis has been performed after the removal of global
 outliers, if any.
 Removal of global outliers (6 systems) for THA2015 changes the situation,
 with three less flagged methods.
 For case BOR2019, the leading method is unflagged after removal of the
 global outliers.
 In the other cases, no effect is observed, which might be due to either
 the absence of global outliers (NAR2019, PER2018, SCH2018, WU2015), or
 the intrinsic shape of the distributions (WU2015, ZAS2019).
 In all these cases, it might also be worth to investigate if the distorted
 shape of the distribution is due to systematic trends in the errors, as
 they could be profitably corrected

 contradictory results for some tail statistics.
 The probability to have

absolute

 errors larger than 1.0 is 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}=0.50$

 for the blue curve and 0.43 for the red curve, hiding the fact that the
 red distribution contains much worse results that the blue one.
 In this case, the problem is solved by the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{95}$

 Shape statistics, such as the kurtosis, would not enable to discriminate

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient present an interesting addition to
 the computational chemistry benchmarking statistical toolbox.
 We focused here on the Gini statistic to study its properties in relation
 with features of the error distributions, such as bias and shape (skewness
 and kurtosis).
 The interest of the Gini coefficient is that it correlates with all these
 features, and offers a one-number summary.
 This is also one of its weaknesses, as there is no unique mapping from
 the Gini coefficient to these features.
 To unscramble this situation, the Gini coefficient of the mode-centered
 distributions 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{MCF}$
\end_inset

 offers a simpler to interpret, shape-based, measure of tailedness.
 Large 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{MCF}$
\end_inset

 values, 
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 above 0.5, alert about large tails that might be due to large skewness,
 kurtosis and/or the presence of outliers.
 For high ranking methods, this is an incentive to inspect closely the error
 distributions and check if the selected methods have problems of reliability
 in their predictions.
